            <h1>Telescope Buying Advice</h1>
<h4>Duncan Armstrong</h4>
<h4>May 11th, 2020</h4>
<p>The kind of telescope should get depends on what you want to do with it and how you’re going to use it.</p>
<br>
<p>The one I got had two constraints: I wanted to be able to see bright objects like the moon, and the major planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Mars, Venus); and I needed to be able to lug it back easily on a plane, and lug it around Brooklyn on foot, so it had to be small and light.</p>
<br>
<p>The main parameters that govern a telescope’s capabilities are aperture size (how much light does it suck in), and focal length (how big is the image it produces). The former is most important for seeing really dim objects like deep space objects, nebulae, galaxies, etc. The latter is most important for seeing small things like planets.</p>
<br>
<p>The main two types of telescopes are reflectors and refractors. Reflectors use mirrors to magnify, and make for big, fat, bulky, open-air telescopes. They’re the best bang for your buck - they’re the cheapest way to get a wide aperture. And because they reflect in order to magnify, they end up being a fraction of the length for any given focal length. Their main downsides are: lower contrast than refractors, and the mirrors are open to the elements, so there’s more maintenance in keeping them in good shape (you need to dust them, clean them out, and recalibrate the mirrors, periodically).</p>
<br>
<p>Refractors are higher contrast, but because there’s no doubling-back of the elements, they have to be very long for a given focal length. And because glass lenses are more expensive than mirrors, they’re a lot more expensive for any given aperture size. But they produce higher-contrast (and better overall) images, and their optics are sealed so they don’t need any maintenance.</p>
<br>
<p>Another downside of refractors: affordable refractors produce quite a lot of what’s called chromatic aberration - basically colored fringing around high-contrast images. You see it with cheap cameras too, usually a purple fringe around contrasty parts of an image. You can spend a <i>lot</i> more money on what are called APO (or apochromatic) refractors, which have fancy modern lens elements that compensate for the aberrations and produce the best possible images. But yeah… ‘spensive.</p>
<br>
<p>The third main telescope is called a Cassegrain, or more specifically a Maksutov-Cassegrain (there are a few variations, but Maks are the most common I think). They’re a sort of modern hybrid between reflectors and refractors, where the main magnification still comes from a mirror, but there’s a lens or two thrown in instead of a secondary mirror (or something like that). The upshot is kind of the best of both worlds: they’re short for a given focal length like reflectors; they’re cheaper than refractors for a given aperture; and their optics are sealed so no internal maintenance required. They’re more expensive than reflectors, but not by too much. And modern ones have good lens coatings that produce better contrast than reflectors - still not as good as refractors, but also without the chromatic aberrations of cheaper refractors.</p>
<br>
<p>So that’s what I got, a Maksutov-Cassegrain. Mine is a 102mm (4”) aperture, with a 1300mm focal length. It’s a really good compromise between being able to see small, dim objects, and being compact and light and low-maintenance. A full moon almost fills the image circle, which is great, and things are magnified enough that you can see Saturn’s rings and Jupiter’s stripes and four big moons, which is so cool. It’s not <i>super</i>-bright with a 4” aperture, so deep-space objects and nebulae are less impressive - but unless you have very clear skies (forget Brooklyn!) you won’t be able to see them well anyway.</p>
<br>
<p>The specific one I got is this guy:</p>

<br>
<p>Skywatcher doesn’t seem to be <i>that</i> widely available in the States, but you can get it at Adorama and B&H. Meade and Celestron are the main American brands, and they’ll make something equivalent I’m sure. It was ~US$400, so a notch above the very entry-level models, but still pretty cheap.</p>
<br>
<p>If portability wasn’t a priority - like if we had a deck or patio it could live on, or a big car to throw it in - I might’ve been tempted by a big reflector. The advice is usually, if you don’t need it to be portable (or pretty!), your first telescope should be a Dobsonian reflector. These are big, fat, suck in tons of light for the money, and are easy (and fun) to use - they swivel on their integrated base, so they don’t need a tripod.</p>
<br>
<p>Something like this would be a hell of a lot of telescope for the money:</p>

<p><img src='Telescope%20Buying%20Advice/sky_watcher_s11610_8_traditional_dobsonian_1141702%202.jpg'></p>
<br>
<p>There are two other important items, beyond the scope itself: the eyepiece and the mount.</p>
<br>
<p>The mount is the thing that attaches the scope to the tripod (assuming it’s not a Dobsonian). The two main manual mount types are alt-az (for altitude-azimuth), which is what most people think of when they think about pointing a telescope - you just angle it up-down and left-right; and equatorial, which is more advanced, and more useful for tracking objects as they move through the sky, but takes more setting up - you have to align the mount with a reference point (usually the North Star) at the start of every session. I went for alt-az because it’s just easier to get going.</p>
<br>
<p>There are also electronic mounts, usually called GOTOs, which can be really clever and powerful, but also super-complicated and hard to set up. There doesn’t seem to have been too much advancement on these, even in the age of smartphones and GPS, so I avoided them. Also, good ones are expensive.</p>
<br>
<p>As for eyepieces, they’re the thing you stick your eye up to. They contain a couple of lenses to achieve a certain magnification of the telescope’s image. The ones that come with a cheaper telescope tend to be bargain basement, and you can get much better for not much additional money. I got one of these for like US$45, and it’s much better than the ones that came with the scope:</p>
